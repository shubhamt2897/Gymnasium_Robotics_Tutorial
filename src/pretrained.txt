In research and industry, you don't always train every model from scratch. It's often more efficient to use a model that has been professionally trained by others and shared with the community. This saves an enormous amount of time and computational resources.

Let's start our next lesson on that.

## Installation
We need a new library, huggingface_sb3, to easily download pre-trained models from the Hugging Face Hub, which is a central repository for sharing ML models.

Run this command in your local WSL terminal:

Bash

pip install huggingface-sb3
## Environment Information
We are still using the FetchPickAndPlace-v3 environment. This allows us to directly compare the behavior of a professionally trained agent to our earlier attempts.

## Lesson Goal
The objective is to download a pre-trained, high-performance agent from the Hugging Face Model Hub and evaluate its performance in our local environment. This will allow us to see what a fully trained, successful agent looks like without needing to train it ourselves.

## Achieving the Goal
We will use the huggingface_sb3 library, which integrates stable-baselines3 with the Hugging Face Hub. The process is simple:

Identify the correct pre-trained model on the Hub. For our case, a great one is araffin/her-FetchPickAndPlace-v3, trained by one of the lead developers of Stable-Baselines3.
Use the load_from_hub function to automatically download the model's .zip file.
Load the downloaded model into our evaluation script just as we did before.
## Coding
Here is the complete script to download and evaluate the pre-trained agent. You can save this as a new file, for example, evaluate_pretrained.py.
