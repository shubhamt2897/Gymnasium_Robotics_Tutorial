# Gymnasium Robotics Tutorial

This project is a hands-on exploration of robotics environments using the [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) library, with a focus on MuJoCo-based environments. The goal is to learn how to set up, train, and evaluate reinforcement learning agents in these simulated robotic tasks.

## Project Goal

*   Understand the fundamentals of Gymnasium for robotics.
*   Implement and train RL agents (e.g., using [Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/)) on various robotics tasks.
*   Learn how to evaluate the performance of trained agents.
*   Explore different robotics environments like Fetch, ShadowHand, etc. (Specify or remove as needed)

## Technologies Used

*   [Python](https://www.python.org/)
*   [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)
*   [MuJoCo](https://mujoco.org/)
*   [Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/) (or other RL libraries you plan to use)
*   [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)

## Setup

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+
*   Git

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (if you haven't already or for others to use):**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubhamt2897/Gymnasium_Robotics_Tutorial.git
    cd Gymnasium_Robotics_Tutorial
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `.venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file will be added here. For now, you can install the core libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install gymnasium[robotics] stable-baselines3[extra]
    # Add other specific libraries like moviepy if needed for recording
    # pip install moviepy
    ```
    *(Consider creating a `requirements.txt` file soon by running `pip freeze > requirements.txt` after installing your base packages).*

## Usage

This section will be updated as the project progresses. It will include instructions on:

*   How to run training scripts (e.g., `python train_agent.py --env <environment_id>`).
*   How to run evaluation scripts (e.g., `python evaluate_agent.py --model_path <path_to_model> --env <environment_id>`).
*   How to use any Jupyter notebooks for experimentation.

### Example (Placeholder)
```python
# Placeholder for a quick example of how to load an environment
import gymnasium as gym

env = gym.make("FetchPickAndPlace-v3", render_mode="human") # Or any other env
observation, info = env.reset(seed=42)

for _ in range(1000):
    action = env.action_space.sample()  # agent policy is here
    observation, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

    if terminated or truncated:
        observation, info = env.reset()
env.close()
```

## Current Status

*   Project initialized.
*   Basic dependencies identified.
*   Focusing on setting up the environment and initial training/evaluation scripts.
*   Currently exploring [mention specific environment or task if you have one, e.g., "FetchPickAndPlace-v3"].

## Next Steps / To-Do

*   [ ] Develop a script for training an agent on a chosen robotics task.
*   [ ] Develop a script for evaluating a trained agent.
*   [ ] Add detailed instructions for running training and evaluation.
*   [ ] Document results and observations.
*   [ ] Explore more complex environments or tasks.
